# Navantia's Digital Transformation Plan

To align its business with the 4.0 revolution, Navantia has initiated its Digital Transformation Plan aimed at adopting measures that enable the harnessing and exploitation of the digital value of its products and services.

As an integrator of equipment and services from the naval sector, Navantia aspires to drive the industry toward their own digital transformation, helping them secure their businesses and meet the expectations that Navantia has for the market.

Navantia's transformation plan includes a set of technological programs to develop new products, services, and smart manufacturing plants. Additionally, it considers other key enabling aspects, with a strong focus on people and 4.0 culture.

One transformational tool in this cyber-physical environment, where the real and virtual worlds merge, is the **Digital Twin (DT)**. 

## The Role of Digital Twins

The Digital Twin, whether of products (assets) or processes (activities), is gaining importance in companies and institutions that provide value-added digital products and services. The digital transformation involves the evolution of Systems Engineering (SE) to a **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** environment. This shift extends the traditional SE "V" model to a "diamond" model in the development of Digital Twins.

A **Digital Twin** is a faithful virtual replica of an element or process, consisting of a set of digital information and algorithms in the form of objects that, when integrated, represent the behavior of that element or process. It is connected or integrated with its physical counterpart, allowing real-time monitoring and the analysis of its real response to various situations, learning to improve performance, operational efficiency, and reaction to similar situations.

Though closely related, it is important to differentiate between the dynamic concept of a Digital Twin and the more static concept of a digital model, which is the digital characterization of a physical product or service. A digital model consists of structured 3D models, attributes, technical documents, functional models, and data according to an information typology of interest. The digital model represents the characteristics of the virtual element, while the Digital Twin "comes to life" by integrating real-time or historical information, offering smart assistance and operational services. 

The model is static, while the twin is dynamic.

According to Gartner, by 2021, half of industrial companies will be using Digital Twins, which will help them increase efficiency by 10%. 

Therefore, there are opportunities in the naval sector (OEM manufacturers or other actors) to acquire greater digital maturity. This requires progressively investing in the ability to generate Digital Twins of their products and core processes as a central element of their digital transformation.

## Why Do Navantia's Customers Want a Digital Twin for Their 21st Century Ships?

Customers highlight the importance of optimizing the maintenance of their units when they enter operation, including existing ones that require repair or modernization. Additionally, training for personnel and crews is essential given the new skills required by emerging technologies and the increased operational capabilities needed to face 21st-century challenges.

The Digital Twin is focused on this customer perspective and helps enhance the competitiveness of the naval sector by optimizing processes and operations through digital technologies.

Navantia also underscores the importance of its supply chain, which currently contributes up to 75% to its operations.

### The Spanish Navy and the Digital Twin

The **Spanish Navy**, a key player in the success of global naval construction programs, recognizes the enormous potential of Digital Twins in improving the operation and maintenance of its ships. Under its **Logistical Support 4.0** and **Arsenals 4.0** vision for advanced maintenance management, the Navy is at the global forefront, entrusting Navantia with the incorporation of a Digital Twin for the first time in its history as part of the **F-110 Frigate** program.

Key functionalities of the F-110's Digital Twin include:
- Virtually representing the ship in real-time.
- Supporting advanced information and management services.
- Supporting intelligent decision-making assistants for operational efficiency and internal security.
- Supporting intelligent agents in specific use cases of interest.

Navantia reflects these new expectations onto the naval sector, requiring equipment, components, models, technical information, and data that are capable of digital integration and exploitation.

## Other Applications of Digital Twins

As Digital Twins receive data from physical devices, they are becoming increasingly important in the design, development, and deployment of **Internet of Things (IoT)**-based solutions, particularly on platforms that facilitate the transmission and management of sensor data from the connected industry.

The concept is continuously evolving toward broader uses and utilities, including Digital Twins of organizations and companies, as well as those of interest in the health sciences. According to **Forbes**, Digital Twins are becoming an essential element in management.

Each activated, connected, and registered device on an IoT platform generally has two categories of associated data:
1. **Metadata (Digital Model)**: These are infrequently changing data that describe the device's configuration, such as serial number, firmware version, manufacturer, model, or year of manufacture.
2. **Dynamic Status Data (Digital Twin)**: These are unique to the device, specific to its context, produced in real-time, and change more frequently. For instance, a weather station would send information on temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.

Web and mobile applications are examples of how IoT-based systems retrieve data for analysis through algorithms, send orders and instructions to the real device, or trigger actions on it. Sometimes, these systems may not have access to the information due to communication problems. In such cases, the virtual capabilities of the twin come into play by simulating the device's behavior without data or by identifying signs of operational degradation if the data is available.

IoT platforms can ensure that the state of the remotely deployed Digital Twin is the same as that of the physical device, even if the device is disconnected. The platform will synchronize the status once the device reconnects.

### Emerging Technologies and Mixed Reality

Advances in **Virtual Reality (VR)**, **Augmented Reality (AR)** (where static and dynamic information is added to the real-world scene), and their evolution toward **Mixed Reality (MR)** enable new experiences through detailed 3D models and high-fidelity scenes. These provide a realistic view of the device in space, complementing its functional perspective, taking a step closer to the virtualization of the equipment and its environment.

New applications and solutions for Digital Twins continue to emerge, blending the best of both worlds. Mixed reality-based applications offer new interaction experiences in challenging or special environments, such as those with low visibility, accessibility limitations to the real element, or high-risk environments for people.
